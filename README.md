In a world where the impact of carbon emissions looms large, finding ways to minimize our carbon footprints is essential. Inspired by the urgent need to address this global challenge, I among four teammates built EcoTrip - a revolutionary web app designed to guide people towards sustainable living and travel.

At its core, EcoTrip is driven by a singular mission: to recommend eco-friendly options for travelers worldwide. Our app empowers individuals to make conscious choices by providing valuable information on sustainable travel alternatives. Say farewell to mindless consumption of fossil fuels and embrace a greener way to explore the world.

With EcoTrip, discovering a wealth of sustainable travel options becomes effortless. Searching for accommodations that align with your eco-conscious values? Our app allows you to easily find green hotels within a specific vicinity or anywhere in the world. Feel confident in your choice, knowing that you're supporting establishments that prioritize sustainability.

But EcoTrip goes beyond just recommending accommodations. By incorporating real-time data and cutting-edge technology, we provide you with precise information. Curious about the carbon emissions associated with a bus ride between two locations? Our integration with the Google Map API enables us to calculate and present the exact amount of CO2 emitted during the journey. Armed with this knowledge, you can make informed decisions and take steps towards reducing your environmental impact.

EcoTrip is more than just a travel app; it's a transformative tool that empowers individuals to make a difference. By choosing eco-friendly options and minimizing your carbon footprint, you become part of a global movement towards a more sustainable future.
